Focus - Emphasizes systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approaches to software development and maintenance. It aims to produce reliable, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
Traditional programming.
Scope - Focuses primarily on the coding or implementation phase of software development.
Focus - Involves writing code to solve specific problems or perform specific tasks, often without considering the broader context of the software lifecycle.

2.Quality & Maintainance.
Software Engineering-Incorporates rigorous testing, code reviews, and quality assurance.Also,Plans for long-term maintenance, addressing bugs, updates, and enhancements
Traditional Programming-Testing may be informal or less structured and maintenance is often reactive, addressing issues as they arise without a long-term plan.

3.Methodology.
Software Engineering-It Produces extensive documentation for requirements, design, testing, and maintenance also, it Involves large, collaborative teams with defined roles.
Traditional Programming-Minimal documentation, mainly code comments and basic user guides.It often involves individual or small teams without formal roles.

4.Tools and techniques.
Software Engineering-Uses advanced tools for project management, version control, automated testing, and CI/CD. It employs design patterns, architectural styles, and formal methods.
Traditional Programming-Uses basic programming environments and tools.Focuses on coding techniques and algorithms specific to solving particular problems.

The software development life cycle provides a structured framework for developing software, ensuring systematic progression through planning, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Planning- This phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, and feasibility. It is crucial for setting the project's direction and allocating resources.It involves activities such as Conducting feasibility studies, risk analysis, cost estimation, scheduling, and resource planning.

Design- This phase focuses on creating the architecture of the software. It involves defining the overall system architecture and the detailed design of its components.Activities involved are High-level design (HLD) for system architecture, low-level design (LLD) for component details, creating data models, and interface designs.

Implemenation (coding) -The actual coding of the software takes place in this phase. Developers write code based on the design documents.Activities involve Writing code, conducting unit tests, debugging, and using version control systems.

Testing-This phase involves verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects.The activities involves Performing various tests such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT); identifying and fixing defects.

Deployment - The software is released to the production environment in this phase. It involves making the software available for use.Activities involves Deployment planning, conducting final testing, user training, and installation.

Maintainance - Post-deployment, this phase involves making necessary updates and enhancements to the software to fix bugs and add new features. It involves Performing regular maintenance, releasing patches and updates, and making performance improvements.

Agile vs Waterfall Models.
Agile - Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.
Phase:
Iterative Development: The project is divided into small iterations, each delivering a potentially shippable product increment.
Continuous Feedback: Regular feedback from stakeholders and customers to refine requirements and improve the product.
Collaboration: Emphasizes teamwork and close collaboration between cross-functional teams.

Waterfall Model-The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.
Phase:
Requirements: All requirements are gathered at the beginning of the project.
Design: A comprehensive design is created based on the requirements.
Implementation: Code is written according to the design.
Verification: Testing is done to ensure the software meets the requirements.
Maintenance: Ongoing support and updates after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
The main Key differences;
Process Flow: Waterfall follows a linear and sequential process, while Agile follows an iterative and incremental process.
Flexibility: Waterfall is rigid and inflexible to changes, while Agile is highly flexible and adaptive.
Documentation: Waterfall emphasizes extensive documentation, while Agile focuses on minimal documentation.
Customer Involvement: Waterfall has limited customer involvement, while Agile promotes continuous customer feedback.
Risk Management: Waterfall has higher risk due to late testing, while Agile has lower risk with continuous testing and feedback.
Scenario where each might be preferred.
Waterfall Model:
Clear and Stable Requirements-Ideal for projects with well-defined, stable, and unchanging requirements.
Regulatory and Compliance Projects-works well for projects that require extensive documentation and adherence to regulatory standards.
Fixed Scope Projects- Best for projects with a fixed scope, timeline, and budget, where changes are minimal or not expected.
Agile Model:
Evolving Requirements- Perfect for projects where requirements are expected to change and evolve over time.
Customer-Centric Projects- Suitable for projects where continuous customer feedback is crucial for success.
Time-Sensitive Projects- Ideal for projects that need to deliver functional software quickly and incrementally, with regular updates and improvements.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
RE is a systematic process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements in the context of the software development process. This is a significant phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) since it guarantees that the final product meets its stakeholders' requirements and expectations such as client's users keep an eye on other people involved in the plan.

Process and Its importance.
Requirements Elicitation:
Task delivering: Interviews, Surveys, Focus groups, Workshops, Observational studies and Review of existing documents.
It should read: A list of stakeholder requirements and expectations, ranked comprehensively.

Requirements Analysis:
Refine and prioritize requirements so that they are clear, achievable, and unambiguous
Activities: Filed to extract conflicts, redundancies and feasibility.documents. Techniques include use case modeling, prototyping and scenario development.
Output: A distilled & ordered collection of requirement, often consisting functional and non-functional a requirements.
